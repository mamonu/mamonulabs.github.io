This is a 1-FU width repanelling of the Blacet Window Comparator.

Some of the uses of the Blacet Window Comparator:

- convert audio signal to gate (audio in to 'In', 'Out' or 'Inverted out' to gate of other module). Playing with the level and width knobs you can get shuffle-like effects this way.

- use as a sawtooth LFO by connecting to the ramp out

- use as square wave oscillator by connecting to one of the two outs (and not connecting anything to the 'In' input). ramp speed controls pitch (adjusting the width and level will give you pwm; this method )

- use as distortion module by inputting audio rate signal into in then patching out and/or inverse out into your mixer

- Use WC as a burst generator:
    * Gate or trigger goes to CV input on Level.
    * Ramp Speed sets the speed of the burst
    * Width set how many of those bursts get through
    * Take your Bursts from either or both of the Out and/or INV Out sockets.


- Use WC as a gate delay:
    * Square wave or Gate into Level CV Input
    * Ramp or Saw into Ramp In
    * Adjust LEVEL & WINDOW to taste.
    * If you have an LFO that can put out a Square wave and a Ramp/Saw wave, all the better.
