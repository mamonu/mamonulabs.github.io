This repo is dedicated to the preservation of information for the ![](https://github.com/FracModular/fracmodular.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/blacet.png) Frac Modular format


This space will hold info / manuals / tidbits for various (some of them discontinued) modules from
companies like Blacet (RIP John), Paia etc together with some interesting DIY choices that are available in this format


I have been a fan of this format since 2009-2010 and lately I have been expanding my frac monolith.
Have a look around. You might find interesting things. Or not. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
